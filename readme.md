# Creating a local server using Express(library)

- First we need to create a environment where we can download dependencies run our file , similar to creating an enivronment to run react app
- We can do that using a command : npm init
- npm init is utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
- Later we can use npm install to install the packages
- One more thing we need to do is run our file using command from script so we will change that in package.json
- So now to run the file you need to use the command npm run start

## Installing express which lets us create a server

- Command : npm install express --save
- Creating a .js file and writing code the code written there will have comments so dont bother to write here
- Next important package to install is dotenv which lets us store secret info in a seperate file and helps in prodcution level as well while deploying
